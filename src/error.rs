//! Error types.

use core::fmt;

/// Every way an operation on a [`crate::Tunnel`] can fail.
///
/// Errors are split into two informal classes, documented per variant:
///
/// * **Attacker-triggerable** (`InvalidPacket`, `InvalidMac1`, `AuthFailure`,
///   `Replay`, …): returned while processing an incoming datagram. The packet
///   has been rejected and **no protocol state was modified and nothing must
///   be sent in response** — WireGuard stays silent toward unauthenticated
///   peers. ([`crate::Stats`] failure counters are still incremented; see
///   that type's note on exposure.) Callers should drop the datagram.
///
///   Do **not** surface the specific attacker-triggerable variant to
///   untrusted observers (logs, per-variant metrics): which variant fires
///   is itself an oracle (e.g. `InvalidMac1` vs `AuthFailure` confirms
///   knowledge of this endpoint's static public key). The "silent toward
///   unauthenticated peers" guarantee covers what is *sent*, not the time
///   taken — which inherently differs between variants — so timing-based
///   identity probing is a known property of the protocol, not of this
///   implementation.
/// * **Caller errors** (`BufferTooSmall`, `NotEstablished`, …): local
///   conditions the caller can act upon.

    NotEstablished,
    /// The datagram is structurally not a WireGuard message (bad length,
    /// unknown type, non-zero reserved bytes). Attacker-triggerable.
    InvalidPacket,
    /// The `mac1` field of a handshake message is wrong, meaning the sender
    /// does not know our public key. Attacker-triggerable; must be dropped
    /// silently per whitepaper §5.3.
    InvalidMac1,
    /// AEAD or handshake authentication failed. Attacker-triggerable. No
    /// plaintext has been written to the output buffer.
    AuthFailure,
    /// A handshake initiation authenticated correctly but was created by a
    /// static key other than the configured peer. Attacker-triggerable (by
    /// other legitimate holders of our public key).
    UnknownPeer,
    /// A handshake initiation carried a TAI64N timestamp not greater than
    /// one we already accepted: a replayed or reordered initiation.
    /// Attacker-triggerable; whitepaper §5.1.
    ReplayedTimestamp,

    UnknownReceiverIndex,

    /// replay window (whitepaper §5.4.6). Attacker-triggerable.
    Replay,

    /// (whitepaper §6.2) and refuses further traffic until rekeyed.

    /// handshake is in flight. Attacker-triggerable (e.g. replayed
    /// response).

    /// A cookie reply failed to decrypt or did not match the `mac1` of the
    /// last handshake message we sent. Attacker-triggerable.
    InvalidCookie,
    /// An explicit handshake was requested more often than once per
    /// `REKEY_TIMEOUT` (whitepaper §6.1: "Under no circumstances will
    /// WireGuard send an initiation message more than once every
    /// Rekey-Timeout."). Caller error.
    HandshakeRateLimited,
    /// The configured [`crate::EntropySource`] reported failure. Caller
    /// environment error; the operation was aborted, no message was
    /// produced.
    EntropyFailure,
    /// A Diffie-Hellman operation involved a low-order/invalid public key
    /// (the shared secret would be all-zero). Attacker-triggerable on the
    /// receive path; a configuration error on the send path.
    InvalidPublicKey,
    /// An internal invariant did not hold. This is a defensive replacement
    /// for `panic!`: it should never be observed, and observing it
    /// indicates a bug in this crate. The tunnel remains in a safe state.
